  <h2>Home</h2>
  <p> I am a 11 year old girl named <strong>Aarushi Mehrotra</strong>.  I live in California, U.S.A. in Silicon Valley.  In Silicon Valley, everybody is pretty tech-y. </p>
  <h3> Family </h3>
  <p> I live with my mom, my dad, and my brother.  My brother is currently nine years old.  In case you didn't figure it out, I'm older than him.  My parents work as software engineers.  Almost everybody is a software engineer in the Silicon Valley. </p>

  <h3> Coding </h3>
  <p> I like coding.  I have actually coded this website by myself - with no template.  I have coded this website in Girls Who Code.  Girls Who Code is a club offered at my school.</p>
  <p> I have mainly learned to code on my own, starting in fourth grade. Even though HTML/CSS is easier, the first programming language I learned was Javascript at Khan Academy. Javascript in Khan Academy was all about drawing and animation. Then I took Khan Academy's course on HTML/CSS (which I used to make this website).  I learned a little bit of SQL and then went to Codeacademy.  At Codecademy, I quickly finished the Javascript and the HTML/CSS course.  I learned jQuery to make webpages interactive easily.  I am now learning PHP. </p>

  <h2> Harry Potter </h2>
  <p> Yes, I love the Harry Potter books so much that I NEED a whole section devoted to it.  If you haven't read the Harry Potter books, you are missing out on LIFE so go read the Harry Potter books.  The first one is called Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Why are you still here?  I said GO READ THE HARRY POTTER BOOKS! Unless you've already read them of course.</p>
  <h3> Information </h3>
  <p> This is just general information for people who have not read the Harry Potter books.  For people who have (good for you!), just skip over it. </p>
  <p> Harry Potter is a seven book series: The Sorcerer's Stone, The Chamber of Secrets, The Prisoner of Azkaban, The Goblet of Fire, The Order of the Pheonix, The Half-Blood Prince, and The Deathly Hallows. </p>

  <h3> Harry Potter Characters </h3>
  <h4> Harry Potter </h4>
  <h4> Hermoine Granger </h4>
  <h4> Ron Weasley </h4>
  <p> There are a zillion other characters, but since this is a website about ME and not Harry Potter, I'm only covering the three main characters. </p>
