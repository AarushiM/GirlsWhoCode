  <h1> All About Me </h1>
  <p> I am a 11 year old girl.  I live in California, U.S.A. in Silicon Valley. </p>
  <h2> Family </h2>
  <p> I live with my mom, my dad, and my brother.  My brother is currently nine years old.  In case you didn't figure it out, I'm older than him.  My parents work as software engineers.  Almost everybody is a software engineer in the Silicon Valley.  My grandparents are visiting me and my family for six months.  They will be going back to India in April. </p>
  <h2> Interests </h2>
  <h3> Coding </h3>
  <p> I like coding.  I have actually coded this website by myself - with no template.  I have coded this website in Girls Who Code.  Girls Who Code is a club offered at my school. </p>
